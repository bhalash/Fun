# Fun
These are small bits and piece that were mostly thrown together for fun.

## Description
I tend to come up with fun little ideas and stick them up on my site. They break down into either helper Bash scripts, or things like an ISBN-10 validator or bogosort spellchecker.

## What's Included
Folder HTML contains my once-off HTML project. The end goal of those projects was to learn JavaScript. They might do someting interesting, but ultimately isn't too novel.

Folder Shell contians Bourne shell scripts that I use on a regular basis.
